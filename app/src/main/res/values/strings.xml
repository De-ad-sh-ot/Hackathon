            Nathu La is one of the three open trading border posts between China and India; the others are Shipkila in Himachal Pradesh and Lipulekh (or Lipulech) at the trisection point of Uttarakhand–India, Nepal and China. Sealed by India after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Nathu La was re-opened in 2006 following numerous bilateral trade agreements. The opening of the pass shortens the travel distance to important Hindu and Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the region and was expected to bolster the economy of the region by playing a key role in the growing Sino-Indian trade. However, trade is limited to specific types of goods and to specific days of the week.

            "Nuranang Falls (also known as Bong Bong Falls), some 100 metres high, is located in the Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh, India. It is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in this part of the country, yet is unknown to many travelers. It lies some 2 kilometres away from the town of Jang on the road connecting Tawang and Bomdila, so it is also known as the Jang Falls. There is a small hydel plant located near the base that generates electricity for local use.
The Nuranang river originates from the Northern slopes of the Sela Pass. Just below the waterfall it falls into the Tawang river.
According to a popular myth, Nuranang river and Nuranang falls are named after a local Monpa girl named Nura who had helped a soldier, Rifleman Jaswant Singh Rawat, Maha Vir Chakra (posthumous) in the 1962 Sino-Indian War and was later captured by the Chinese forces. The actual circumstances of Jaswant\'s heroism are more prosaic and no woman finds a place there. It is possible that the name Nuranang was bestowed well before 1962."

        <item>The \'khar\' is a dish which is probably unique to the state of Assam. A traditional Assamese meal always begins with a \'khar\' with some rice.It is believed that khar cleanses the stomach. The prepared dish is called khar and so is the main ingredient that goes into it.</item>
        <item>Traditionally, this dish is considered to be a delicacy cooked and served on special occasions like Bihu, feast or for special guests. Even now-a-days, this dish is still integral part of any celebration or festivities.

Though there are many variety of ducks available in Assam and NE India, we are going to talk about Paati Hanh (a type of mallard duck). People from Assam and NE region also like geese, wild ducks (especially a variety called as Xorali Hanh, a migratory duck, it is illegal to hunt for one though!) and this preparation can also be done for them.
</item>
        <item>Masor Tenga (Tangy Fish Curry), is an indispensable part of a proper meal in Assam. This is a light and tangy dish, and is one of Assam\'s signature preparations. The key ingredient in a tenga is the use of a souring agent like lemon or tomato which lends the dish a tart tangy taste. I being a fish addict, when saw this recipe in one of a popular food forum, could not stop myself and recreated the same in my kitchen some days back. It can be best enjoyed with plain rice.</item>
        <item>Aloo Pitika is a signature side dish from Assam. It is a dish made with mashed potatoes mixed with few ingredients that enhances the flavor. The three basic ingredients which are combination of raw onions, salt and uncooked mustard oil is enough to take the whole platter to a different aromatic level. Sometimes aloo pitikas might even be garnished by finely chopped cilantro leaves, pumpkins, gourds, boiled eggs or even crushed dry fishes in the normal pitika. Making aloo pitika is quick as well as a simple process.</item>

The legends say that at one point of time many years ago there was a saint whose name was Tenteling. The holy saint decided to do a tough meditation on top of the mountain which was called Gangrikarpo which was located in the Himalayan mountains. The holy saint is believed to be doing a tough meditation continuously for three long years without having any kind of food or drink. It was also believed that in the ridges of the Himalayan range where the saint was meditating had two snow lions residing there. The snow lions were astonished and surprised to see that the saint was meditating for such a long time without consuming any food or drink. In order to be of some help to the holy saint, the lions offered their milk to the saint in order to facilitate their survival in a major way. The saint after completing the meditation danced with the lion making merry and this form of dance was named as the  lion and peacock dance.

        <item>Ponung (Adi Tribe)\n\n
        The Adi tribes are an important tribe who lived in Arunachal Pradesh and are a no nonsense group of people, disturbing nobody and letting nobody disturb them. Adi means hill and very true to their names, these tribals live on mountain tops. They are generally found in East Siang, Upper Siang, West Siang and some parts of the Lower Dibang valley. The Adi tribes are very disciplined and righteous. They have a leader amongst them and they have a customary court, and the tribes follow any rules laid out by the old and wise people of this tribe. Rice wet cultivation is one of their most important occupation, and considering that theirs is an agricultural economy, this is the most important activity here.
        The Ponung dance is performed by the Adi tribes just before they harvest their full grown crops – they thank God for having taken care of their crops – because this is their sole form of food which is key to their survival. They also pray for the upcoming harvest season, and request God to shower the same grace for the forthcoming seasons too. The other main reason for the dance is to ensure that the entire village prospers.
        In the Ponung dance, all dancers except one are young married women. These women stand in a circle, and are ready to sing and dance. The one dancer who is a male dancer, is the leader or Miri. He is old, and has a fair understanding and knowledge about the food grains and the soil. He is proficient in agricultural terms and has ample experience in the same too. He sings legendary songs that are very relevant to the harvest – sometimes there are about how paddy came into existence, and at others about other crops. These songs that are sung by him show his experience in cultivation, and also the trust that the younger generation has put into him. He has in his possession, the Yoksha which is a musical instrument resembling a sword. He holds this high, and continues to jiggle this all through the dance performance. The Yoksha has rings of iron circles fixed and this starts to vibrate as he moves the instrument.
        The women all stand in a circular pattern and when they stand like that they extend their hands and spread it out, such that every woman touches her neighbor’ shoulder. The Miri stands in the center point of this circle and starts singing and dancing. The song is generally about how paddy came into being – in local language this is call the Abhanga. Since the Miri is quite experienced and old with wisdom, he does a fabulous job in singing the Abhanga. The women, who stand around him, immediately repeat what they heard their leader sing. Once they finish singing, they start their rhythmic dancing. This is very slow, and at no point in time do we see the speed.
        Though this dance is performed, in the majority cases at times of harvest and cultivation, there are many auspicious occasions where we can see the performance of Ponung Adi. Life is full of such auspicious events – marriages, child birth, religious functions being some of them and at most of these instances, the Miri and the young married women gear up for the Ponung Adi dance.\n</item>


        <item>Popir (Adi Tribe)\n\n
        The history of the Popir dates back to very old times, and it is considered to have been practiced even in the very olden days. The people of the Galo tribes were always a religious group of people and they had religion embedded into every action of theirs. They celebrated religious festivals and the Mopin festival was considered the most important. The Popir dance is performed at the time of celebrating Mopin. The Galo tribes of people were a God fearing set of people and believed that if God was with them nobody can be against them. This strong belief is seen is all their practices and their festivals. They trust that the God is the supreme power and there can nothing that God can’t do. So, they celebrated this faith in them and performed dances where they pleased their Gods. The Popir dance has its origin in that belief of the Galos. The Mopin festival is the harvest festival of the Adi Tribes. They celebrate this festival and thank God for the hearty harvest that they have received for the year. Since cultivation is the main economy in north eastern India, the harvest assumes prime significance. The year that the harvest is good will mean the whole economy is flourishing – so good harvest is very important to the Adi Tribes. At the time of the harvest festival, the Adi tribes, get together and sing praises of God and thank him for the magnanimous harvest. They sing about how kind God has been to them and they pray to him to continue to shower His mercy on them – so that they continue to reap this rich harvest year on year, thereby making their economy thrive. This could also be considered as one of the folk dances where the tribes give thanks to the Gods. The Mopin festival is also celebrated to drive away the evil and bring in the good things. The tribes actually pray to God to chase the bad or evil spirits and take them away from their tribes, so that their tribesmen, women and children are safe and healthy. The Adi tribes believe in the existence of ghosts and other evil spirits and practically trust that just like there is dark when there is light, there is bad when there is good. So, these tribes also pray to God to keep the bad spirits away and to keep them safe from them. They believe that these bad spirits can cause disease, earthquakes or other disturbances and hence pray so that they can be prevented from these. Young girls perform this Mopin dance and since rice is a prominent cereal and an important meal of the Adi Tribes, this is served during the dishes performed at the time of this festival. These young girls wear white dresses and dress up well. They wear many layers of bead chains of many colors giving the white dress a very magical appearance. They put rice flour on each other’s faces as a way of celebration. At the time of this Mopin festival, the women cook extensive meals and even make wine out of rice! They serve this wine and celebrate and also make and serve many dishes. Special mention is to be made about Aamin, which is a rice based dish. The other accompaniments are meat and the shoot of bamboo. So, every year on the day of the Mopin festival, the Adi tribals, eat Aamin, drink rice wine, dust each other wish rice flour and dance the Popir dance – to seek the blessings of their tribal god.\n</item>

        <item>The Saga Dawa Festival honors the life of Buddha. According to their tradition, when Buddha was dying, he instructed one of his followers not to honor him merely with flowers, incense and lights after he died but by striving to follow his teachings about living a noble life and being kind and compassionate. He urged people not to weep about his death but to remember that all compound objects like the human body must eventually disintegrate. In various Buddhist countries, people celebrate the holiday in different ways and on different days. In China, non-Tibetan Buddhists will celebrate the holiday on May 10, 2011. In Tibet, the people celebrate the festival on June 15, 2011 and June 4, 2012, and the main activities involve going to temples, raising a tall prayer pole called the Tarboche Prayer Flagpole, and lighting a lot of butter lamps for the occasion.</item>

        <item>Cane and bamboo contribute a great deal to the lifestyle and economy of Assam. Many varieties grow in abundance and each has its own special uses. Bamboo in particular is an integral part of architecture in the villages.
Cane and bamboo are also used in making furniture as well as many other day-to-day articles like beer mugs, sieves and various tools and utensils.
One of the most important articles is the japi, a traditional wide brimmed Assamese hat, made from strips of bamboo and tokow paat (dried palm leaves) and used by outdoors workers for protection from the sun. These days they are also used as decorative items in drawing rooms and have become a popular souvenir for tourists.</item>
        <item>Metal crafts in Assam consist of generally bell metal and brass metal. Their use can be seen even in ancient times in utensils and statues. Today, they are also used for making fancy household items. During the days of Royalty, even gold and silver were used. But now they are only used in making jewelery. Hajo and Sarthebari villages are the most famous for metal works in Assam. They are quite close to Guwahati, so you can easily get their products in the many shopping markets in the capital city.</item>
        <item>In Assam the craft of making pottery can be traced back many centuries. The two traditional potter communities in Assam are the Kumar and the Hira.
Kumar is a Hindu caste name indicating that the profession followed by the majority of that particular group of people is pottery. The process followed by these people has not changed much since ancient times. They dig clay which they then beat and knead with the hands, feet or mallets of stone or wood and use a chaak (potter’s wheel) to fashion different utensils which are then fired in a panja (kiln). They then paint the finished articles.
In particular, pottery is made in Majuli, a large river island in the Brahmaputra River and cultural capital and cradle of Assamese civilisation, from beaten clay and burnt in driftwood fired kilns exactly as it was during the ancient Harrappan civilisation over 4,000 years ago.
The most commonly made pottery products are household articles such as pots, pitchers, plates, incense-stick holders, and earthern lamps as well as some more modern design ornaments.</item>
        <item>Weaving is one of the oldest industries in the state and Assam is well known for its rich textures and designs leading Gandhiji to compliment Assamese weavers as artists who could weave dreams in their looms. So important is this ancient craft it is customary for all young Assamese girls to learn to weave in order to make a marriage match. The industry has been kept alive by the many tribes residing in Assam, which boasts the largest number of weavers and handlooms in the whole of India.
Traditionally every handloom fabric created was unique because the colours and designs varied from weaver to weaver who poured her own personality into the creation using images of birds, animals, creepers, flowers and people in the pattern as well as embroidering motifs on the finished article. Each ethnic group has its own distinctive design and style. Today, however, designers do incorporate patterns and designs based on market demand and the Regional Design Centre at Guwahati supplies new designs and colour patterns to the indigenous handloom societies in the state.
The raw materials mainly used are cotton, the world famous muga or golden silk, pat the white or “mulberry” silk and the warm eri or endi.</item>
        <item>The woodwork industry in Assam was prolific in ancient times when the forests were abundant with rare and valuable woods like sandalwood, salmali, agaru and vata (banyan). It was traditionally carried out by a group of people named khonikors who hand carved wooden decorations in the palaces of the Ahom rulers. It is reported that their work was so highly regarded and popular with the royals that a separate village called Khonikargaon was built for them near Sibsagar in the district of the same name.
Testimony to the artistic creations of the khonikars is evident in many naamghars (prayer houses) and sattras (Vaishnava monasteries) in Assam and the indigenous tradition of wood-working still continues in the district of Sibsagar. Here local carpenters still make simghashan, throne-type structures which are often supported by four elephants, twenty-four lions and seven tigers, kharai (book rests) and carve the wooden doors, windows and beams of the prayer houses and monasteries with mythical figures like Hanuman, the monkey deity who featured in the story of the Ramayana, leaving visitors awe-struck by their beauty.</item>
        <item>Dating back from ancient times Assam has built up a rich collection of traditional jewellery designs unique and exclusive to the state that hold a special place in the hearts of Assamese women and are worn during cultural and religious events. Jorhat, the 2nd biggest city in Assam located in the district of Jorhat is the main jewellery-making centre and thousands of natives and visitors flock there every day to browse in the numerous outlets. This district also has a number of small scale cottage industries where skilled jewellery-makers also work.
Assamese jewellery is mainly made from gold which was found in abundance in many Himalayan rivers, notably the Subansiri, flowing through the state and which originally gave rise to the industry. A division of the Bodo-Kachari family, a tribe called the Sonowal Kacharis, were especially engaged in gold panning of river sand during the reign of the Ahom kings, hence their name Sonowal, meaning gold washer. Apart from gold other metals like silver were also used in conventional jewellery-making.</item>
        <item>The traditional paintings of Assam serve as a source of inspiration to thousands of art lovers around the globe. Renowned for their unmatched quality and outstanding strokes of mastery, they have become an integral part of Assam’s rich heritage. With origins traced back to the seventh century AD, Assamese paintings were illustrations inspired by the epic mythological tales like the Mahabarata. Many original ancient manuscripts have been collected from all over the state and published complete with their original illustrations. They were executed on bark and a fine lint-like surface known as tulapat.
Some of the original manuscripts are on display at the Assam State Museum in Guwahati while others are in the hands of private collectors. In addition the Assam Fine Arts and Crafts Society in Guwahati and the Jorhat Fine Arts Society in Jorhat are also playing significant roles in preserving the rich cultural heritage of the state.
This form of art was not restricted to just manuscript, however, and although limited, evidence does exist of paintings on woodwork, muga silk and other surfaces.</item>
